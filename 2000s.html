                <h2>Color</h2>
                <p>Acute gradients were popular throughout this decade. Color was used more tactically than the 90s with
                    apparent color palettes.</p>

                <h2>Typography</h2>
                <p>Typography in the 2000s was often more stylized than in the 90s, with the use of custom fonts and
                    text
                    effects being more common. Links were often styled with color, and text was often given a drop
                    shadow
                    or emboss effect.</p>

                <h2>Layout</h2>
                <p>Layout in the 2000s was often more complex than in the 90s, with the use of gradients, drop shadows,
                    and rounded corners being more common. The use of background images was also more common, often
                    distractingly so.</p>

                <h2>Imagery</h2>
                <p>Images were used liberally to the point of being distracting in many cases.</p>
