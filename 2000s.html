                <h2>Typography</h2>
                <p>Typography in the 2000s was often more stylized than in the 90s, with the use of custom fonts and
                    text
                    effects being more common. Links were often styled with color, and text was often given a drop
                    shadow
                    or emboss effect.</p>
