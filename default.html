                    <h2>The 90s</h2>
                    <p>Web design in the 90s was characterized by the use of HTML and CSS. Websites were simple and
                        static, with little to no interactivity. The most popular websites of the time were Yahoo, AOL,
                        and
                        eBay.</p>

                            - Grainy images
                            - Colored icons
                            - Cheesy colored box/drop shadows and borders
                            - Bulleted lists
                            - Unstyled links (except for color - red or blue)

                    <h2>The 2000s</h2>
                    <p>Web design in the 2000s saw the rise of Flash and JavaScript, which allowed for more
                        interactivity
                        and
                        animation. Websites became more dynamic and visually appealing, with the introduction of
                        multimedia
                        content such as videos and music.</p>

                            - Mix of sharp and slightly rounded corners, often asymmetric borders
                            - Colored, low res icons
                            - Harsh gradients

                            - Liberal use of background images, often distractingly so

                    <h2>The 2010s</h2>
                    <p>Web design in the 2010s was characterized by the widespread use of responsive design, which
                        allowed
                        websites to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This decade also saw the rise of social
                        media
                        and mobile browsing, leading to the development of mobile-first design principles.</p>

                    <h2>The 2020s</h2>
                    <p>Web design in the 2020s is characterized by the use of modern web technologies such as HTML5,
                        CSS3,
                        and
                        JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular. Websites are more interactive and visually
                        appealing,
                        with a focus on user experience and accessibility.</p>
