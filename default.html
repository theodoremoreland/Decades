                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Good web design requires attention to detail, detail that is often too subtle to recognize
                        without practice and study.
                        In my pursuit to bring these subtleties to light, I explore how web design has evolved
                        over time. In juxtaposing
                        the design trends of the last four decades, I hope to unravel patterns in making good web
                        designs.

                    <h2>Objective</h2>
                    <p>The objective of this project is to compare design trends across the last four decades, but doing
                        so with a particular focus.
                        In an effort to establish clear contrast without overburdening myself on technical details (e.g.
                        Flash, JavaScript, etc.),
                        I will focus on a handful of visual dimensions.
                    </p>
                    <p>The dimensions I will be focusing on are as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Color</li>
                        <li>Typography</li>
                        <li>Layout</li>
                        <li>Imagery</li>
                        <li>Interative elements</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The 90s</h2>
                    <p>Web design in the 90s used a lot of bulleted lists, bevel and emboss effects, crude shadows and
                        borders, and use of color that, by today's standards, do not complement each other well.</p>

                            - Bevel and emboss effects
                            - Animated GIFs
                            - Animated cursor
                            - Grainy images
                            - Colored icons
                            - Cheesy colored box/drop shadows and borders
                            - Bulleted lists
                            - Unstyled links (except for color - red or blue)
                            - Unstyled forms and fields
                            - Unstyled scrollbars
                            - Welcome text
                            - Jarring color palette

                    <h2>The 2000s</h2>
                    <p>Web design in the 2000s made liberal use of acute gradients and background images, but still
                        featured many of the unstyled HTML elements from the 90s.</p>

                            - Grainy images
                            - Mix of sharp and slightly rounded corners, often asymmetric borders
                            - Colored, low res icons
                            - Harsh gradients
                            - Unstyled links (except for color)
                            - Unstyled forms and fields
                            - Unstyled scrollbars
                            - Liberal use of background images, often distractingly so

                    <h2>The 2010s</h2>
                    <p>Web design in the 2010s upped the resolution of images (and corresponding screens), making them
                        more appropriate for larger sizes. Headers and footers were also enlarged. Designs were often
                        more minimalistic with layouts reminiscent of newspapers and magazines.</p>
                    <!-- 
                            - Large, high res images
                            - Newspaper and magazine layouts
                            - Minimalist design
                            - Oversized headers and footers

                    <h2>The 2020s</h2>
                    <p>Web design in the 2020s is the age of dynamic presentations. Things such as text or images that
                        appear as the user scrolls have become fairly common.</p>
