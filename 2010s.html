                <h1>The 2010s</h1>
                <p>Web design in the 2010s was characterized by the use of flat design, large hero images, and the use
                    of
                    color that was often more subdued than in the 90s and 2000s. Typography was often more stylized than
                    in the 90s, but less so than in the 2000s.</p>

                <!-- 
                            - Large, high res images
                            - Newspaper and magazine layouts
                            - Minimalist design
                            - Oversized headers and footers

                <p>Color in the 2010s was often more subdued than in the 90s and 2000s, with a lot of pastel colors
                    being
                    used. The use of color was often more consistent, with a particular color palette being used
                    throughout the website.</p>
