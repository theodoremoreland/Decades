                    <h2>Color</h2>
                    <p>Color in the 2010s was often more subdued than in the 90s and 2000s, with a lot of pastel colors
                        being
                        used. The use of color was often more consistent, with a particular color palette being used
                        throughout the website.</p>

                        use of custom fonts and text effects was less common, and text was often left unstyled, with the
                        default font and size being used.</p>

                        often
                        more common.</p>
