                <h1>The 2020s</h1>
                <p>Web design in the 2020s is the age of dynamic presentations. Things such as text or images that
                    appear as the user scrolls have become fairly common.</p>

                <h2>Color</h2>
                <p>Color in the 2020s is often more subdued than in the 90s and 2000s, with a lot of pastel colors
                    being used. The use of color is often more consistent, with a particular color palette being used
                    throughout the website.</p>

                <h2>Typography</h2>
                <p>Typography in the 2020s is often more stylized than in the 90s and 2000s, with the use of custom
                    fonts and text effects being more common. Links are often styled with color, and text is often
                    given a drop shadow or emboss effect.</p>

                    images is often more subtle.</p>
