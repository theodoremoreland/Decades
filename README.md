## Overview

This project was a homework assignment for Lindenwood University's *Fundamentals of HTML* course (2024). The requirements for this assignment goes as follows:
- 6 HTML Pages
- No JavaScript
- No networking, HTTP requests, etc
- 1 style.css file

While the assignment had a few requirements, the overall concept was up to us. I chose to make a few webpages that highlighted web design trends across four decades of web design. The landing page would serve as the introduction and overview for the concept, one page would be dedicated to resources and citations, meanwhile the other 4 pages would each exemplify trends for a corresponding decade.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3


## Future improvements

- Complete first draft of 2020s page
- Test and modify for responsiveness
- Refactor and abstract style.css into separate files
- Add all citations of images and sources used throughout project
