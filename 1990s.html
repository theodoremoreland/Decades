                <h1>The 90s</h1>
                <p>Web design in the 90s used a lot of bulleted lists, bevel and emboss effects, crude shadows and
                    borders, and use of color that, by today's standards, do not complement each other well.</p>
                <!-- 
                        - Bevel and emboss effects
                        - Animated GIFs
                        - Animated cursor
                        - Grainy images
                        - Colored icons
                        - Cheesy colored box/drop shadows and borders
                        - Bulleted lists
                        - Unstyled links (except for color - red or blue)
                        - Unstyled forms and fields
                        - Unstyled scrollbars
                        - Welcome text
                        - Jarring color palette
                -->

                    <h2>Color</h2>
                    <p>Color in the 90s was often jarring, with a lot of bright, saturated colors that did not
                        complement
                        each other well. The use of color was often inconsistent and did not follow any particular
                        pattern.</p>

                    <h2>Typography</h2>
                    <p>Typography in the 90s was often unstyled, with the exception of color. Text was often left
                        unstyled, with the default font and size being used. Links were often styled with color, but
                        nothing else.</p>

                    <h2>Layout</h2>
                    <p>Layout in the 90s was often unstructured, with a lot of bulleted lists and unstyled forms and
                        fields. The use of tables was common, and the use of frames was also common.</p>

                    <h2>Imagery</h2>
                    <p>Imagery in the 90s was often grainy, with the use of animated GIFs and colored icons. The use of
                        images was often inconsistent and did not follow any particular pattern.</p>

                    <h2>Interactive Elements</h2>
                    <p>Interactive elements in the 90s were often unstyled, with the exception of color. Links were
                        often
                        styled with color, but nothing else. Forms and fields were often unstyled, and scrollbars were
                        often unstyled.</p>
